# Pytorch Implementation of Stochastic Mirror Descent Algorithm on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This library provides implementation of Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD) algorithm with any p-norm potential function. There are examples of 1-norm potential function and 2-norm potential function(SGD). This library can be used to reproduce results of [1].
